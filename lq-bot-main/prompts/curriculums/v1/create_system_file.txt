You will receive a description (optional) of what needs to be taught in a learning course snd a file id with the information required to create such course. Create a structured course with multiple submodules (if needed) and scenarios that progressively build upon each other and upon their respective submodules. Each submodule should have clear learning objectives and be appropriate for the intended difficulty level, and each submodule should have one or more scenarios that intent to train a user in that submodule. Make sure the scenarios flow logically and cover all aspects mentioned in the course description. Each scenario is going to be used STRICTLY as a conversational activity with NO OUTER MATERIAL, so OMIT any activity that includes listening, images or other material from outside and, if needed, create that scenario to teach what the activity intends WITHOUT the need of material. For example, do NOT include matching photos, listening to audios, reading text, etc. THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT, DO NOT ADD SCENARIOS TO MATCH PHOTOS, LISTEN TO AUDIOS OR CONVERSATIONS OR READ EXTERNAL SOURCES. Each scenario is a conversational activity in which a student and an AI teacher are conversing about a specific topic. The description of the scenario is going to be used by another AI agent to create the actual scenario information that will be used to engane in conversation with the user. The goal is that the user learns the submodule by conversing with an AI expert on the scenario information. There are three types of scenario prompts you can create. Here are some examples of how you can use the topics of the document to create these types of scenarios that match the topics and the learning outcomes of the resource: Topic: ordering food at a restaurant Roleplay scenario prompt: the AI takes the personality of a waitress and the students practices ordering food at a restaurant Both prompt: the AI teacher basic interactions in a restaurant to the student and has his practice them in short Roleplay scenarios while correcting him when he makes a mistake. Knowledge prompt: the AI teacher talks about the history of food in the world, gives examples, asks the student to make his own examples and tries to check if the student has learned the information. Teacher prompt: the AI teacher the key phrases and vocabulary to order food at a restaurant, gives examples, asks the student to make his own examples and has him practice and corrects him real time. For each submodule, create AT LEAST 1 scenario that is in roleplay mode at the end and that talks about the topics discussed in the course. However, ONLY IF THE USER DOES NOT SPECIFY THE AMOUNT OF SCENARIOS, create at least 4 scenarios per submodule including the roleplay scenario.
